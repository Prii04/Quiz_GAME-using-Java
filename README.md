# Interactive Quiz Game Using Java

## Overview
This is a Java-based interactive quiz game application built using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. The game allows players to select their difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and answer multiple-choice questions within a 30-second time limit per question. Players can track their score in real-time and view their final results at the end of the quiz. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how to build interactive desktop applications in Java while exploring concepts like event handling, timers, and UI design.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Difficulty Selection**: Players can choose between three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level contains a unique set of questions tailored to its complexity.
- **Customizable Game Length**: Players can specify how many questions they want to answer during the game.
- **Timer for Each Question**: A 30-second countdown timer ensures players answer questions quickly. If the timer runs out, the game automatically moves to the next question.
- **Score Tracking**: Correct answers increase the player's score. Incorrect answers are highlighted in red, and the correct answer is shown in green.
- **Skip and Next Buttons**: Players can skip a question or move to the next one after answering.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays total questions, correct answers, wrong answers, and the final score. Includes options to replay the game or quit.
- **Replay Functionality**: Players can restart the game with shuffled questions without restarting the application.
- **Quit Option**: Allows players to exit the game at any time and view their current results.

### Additional Features
- **Hint Button**: Provides hints by disabling incorrect options, helping players make informed choices.
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Allows players to pause the game and resume it later.
- **Sound Effects**: Plays sound effects for correct and wrong answers, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Code Structure

### Classes
- **`QuizGame`**:
  - The main class that initializes the game window and handles the game logic.
  - Manages UI components, question display, scoring, and timers.
- **`Question`**:
  - Represents a single quiz question with its text, answer choices, and the index of the correct answer.

### Key Methods
- `initializeUI()`: Sets up the graphical user interface.
- `showLevelSelectionDialog()`: Prompts the user to select difficulty and number of questions.
- `initializeQuestions()`: Loads questions based on the selected difficulty.
- `shuffleQuestions()`: Randomizes the order of questions.
- `showQuestion()`: Displays the current question and starts the timer.
- `startQuestionTimer()`: Starts the 30-second countdown for each question.
- `handleTimeUp()`: Handles scenarios when the timer runs out.
- `endQuiz()`: Displays the game-over screen with final results.
- `nextQuestion()`: Moves to the next question or ends the game if all questions are answered.

## Customization

### Adding New Questions
To add more questions:
1. Open the `initializeQuestions()` method in the `QuizGame` class.
2. Add new `Question` objects to the respective difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, or `Hard`).
   Example:
   ```java
   questions.add(new Question("What is the capital of Australia?", 
       new String[]{"Sydney", "Melbourne", "Canberra", "Brisbane"}, 2));
   ```

### Modifying the Timer
To change the timer duration:
1. Locate the `startQuestionTimer()` method.
2. Modify the `timeRemaining` variable to your desired value (e.g., 60 for a 1-minute timer).
